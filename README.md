This map will allow the New York City based nonprofit Rethink Food to analyze a key part of its operations. Rethink Food delivers meals from restaurants to asylum seeker shelters, and this map shows which shelters are accessible from each restaurant in 30 minutes or less. The data here can help Rethink pair restaurants with shelters and identify areas of the city where new restaurants should be added, helping ensure asylum seekers get food that is as fresh as possible.
